# Mersenne Primes
The following notebooks aim to explore a fascinating integer series called the Mersenne Primes. It's a function whose domain and range are all prime numbers. It can be written as:

f(x) = 2<sup>x</sup> - 1

When x is a prime number and f(x) is also prime, this is considered a Mersenne Prime. 

To date, there are only 51 identified Mersenne Primes. The most recently discovered was on December 07, 2018. It is 2<sup>82589933</sup> - 1. The value of that Mersenne Prime expression contains 24,862,048 digits.

The notebooks contained herein have CSV writers for primes and Mersenne Primes and a verification tool. The are also some example prime range files in output/ranges/.
